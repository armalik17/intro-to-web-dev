      <h3> About Us </h3>
      <p> The Light House Café is the only establishment missing on Ville University’s campus. The Light House Café will be dedicated to supplying healthy food options for students, to promote better brain functioning for learning, while also helping with Seasonal Depression. This is be done, by the use of Light Boxes, that will be installed throughout the Café. Light Boxes are used as a form of therapy for individuals the experience Seasonal Depression. This therapy technique has been proven to help with alleviating Seasonal Depression symptoms. Ultimately, allowing students to continue to perform to the best of their abilities throughout the whole semester.</p>

      <p> Many students experience Seasonal Depression, but do not have the resources to help them with this disorder. Even if there are resources provided, there is not enough awareness on campus for students to know where to go to access these resources.</p>

      <p> The Light House Café does not only provide the resources that these students desperately need, it also promote awareness for mental health. Providing a safe and inclusive place for students and faculty to visit.</p>
