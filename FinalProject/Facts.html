    <h2> NON-REM Sleep Facts:</h2>
  <h4> 1. New memories are cemented during non-REM sleep. Walker describes this as the brain’s way of “hitting the save button.” Memories are moved from short-term storage areas of the brain to the cerebral cortex, where long-term memories are filed. The brain also seems to be deleting information that might be unnecessarily taking up storage space. </h4>

  <h4>2. Non-REM sleep helps strengthen and consolidate information you’ve accumulated throughout the day. The brain compares new data with previously known information. New connections are made, resulting in a “system update” of sorts. </h4>

  <h4>3. There are three phases of non-REM sleep. Each stage can last from 5 to 15 minutes. You go through all three phases before reaching REM sleep </h4>
